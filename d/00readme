Readme file for /d

This directory is for domains.  Domains are realms or regions that have a
theme that is different to the main theme, and other domain themes.  There
is an option in include/living/living.cfg to destruct items when a player is
moved from one domain to another, so that theme items do not mix in silly
ways. Eg. Laser cannons in Medievil realm.  A new domain is created
automatically with the 'domain' command.

access.c 	Access object that controls all access to domain directories.
