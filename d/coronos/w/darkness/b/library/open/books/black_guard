THE BLACK GUARD OF ILLE CORONOS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Black Guard was established during the Year of our Lord 123, in the Second 
Age of Magic. The Guard was created as an elite unit designed for the protection
of The Circles members, delegates and envoys. They are considered the best 
warriors within the city, undergoing rigorous trials just to be accepted in 
to the Guard. Their motto, "Victory in Death", displays their total loyalty 
to their commanding officers and to the preservation of The Circle, they are 
wiling to die and see it as a fitting end if The Circle and its members are 
saved. 

The founding officer was Curzon Bane, a half-elf bounty hunter, who came 
on as a personal quest to Ille Coronos. While on this quest he 
accompanied the founding Circle members on a hunt for some Leucrotta 
that were terrorising the neighbouring wood elves. After helping slay the foul 
beasts, Lord Bain or just Bain as he prefers it, decided to stay and help 
his new found allies in the construction of their new city. It was during 
this time that Curzon met Commander Thomas Thorbest, cleric of Saint Arion. 
Sharing the same views on battle and tactics, the two men became fast friends. 

When Thorbest was elected Circle member in charge of security his first duty 
was to instate Bain as head of an elite guard designed to protect The Circle 
members. Thus the Black Guard was created. 

Thorbest and Bain decided that they should take members from all races 
within the jurisdiction of the new city. Hence admittance into the ranks of 
the Black Guard is not based on race. It is, however, based on skill with 
weapons and great skill at that! The entrants must undergo four tests:

1. The Test of the Warriors Mind
The entrant must show a complete understanding of the workings of his/her 
weapons and the styles applicable to it.

2. The Test of the Warriors Skill
The entrant must show an outstanding ability with his/her selected weapon 
against varied opponents.

3. The Test of the Warriors Knowledge
The entrant must show an understanding of tactics in single, duel and multiple 
combat.

4. The Test of the Warriors Soul
The entrant must show courage and loyalty under a simulated situation which 
would lead to certain death.

After passing these tests the entrant must then wear oaths of fealty 
to their commanding officers and then The Circle members themselves. These 
oaths are sworn before three clerics of the All-God to ensure truth and 
loyalty are shown. The entrant is then sworn in as a member of the Black 
Guard by the Lord of Ille Coronos and given his armour by the Head of The 
Guard. The entrant must then spend the first twenty four hours of his duty 
guarding a council member chosen by The Circle. 


The Tenets of The Black Guard
1. Obey all laws set out by The Circle of Ille Coronos
2. Obey all orders from commanding officers in respect to the first tenet.
3. Protect Circle members with all your skill, all your heart, and all your 
soul.
4. There is no dishonour in death, but rather a fulfilment and the start 
of a new journey.
5. Spend one day a week in prayer and fasting to your chosen deity.
6. Spend non-working days in training but not totally; remember your family 
and your friends.
7. Obey all tenets set down here to the utmost of your ability and further 
the dream of Ille Coronos.

Personalities within the Black Guard
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Gabriel Thorne: Gabriel comes from the army of Lord Shadowbane. Highly 
decorated in battle, Thorne have up his commission to become an inaugural 
member of the Black Guard. He has a distinctive fighting style using 
a sabre and morning star to great effect. Thorne has become a close 
friend of Bains and they are often seen together at the waterfront when 
they are not needed, gaming and drinking with the sailors and merchants.

Stuart OBrien: Stuart is a sailor at heart. Whenever he has a free moment 
he can be found out in his boat, trying to teach his friend Karak to 
fish, without much success. He seems out of place within the grim and 
solemn Black Guard, but his fighting ability and tactical nous make him 
an integral part of the unit. 

Karak: Karak appeared not long after the formation of the Black Guard. 
No one knows where he came from, just that one day a minotaur appeared 
on the beach and asked to join the Guard. He then promptly passed all 
the tests with amazing results, besting most of the Guard in single combat. 
Reluctant to take on a total officiary role, Karak is quite content to 
be the 1st officer to Augustus McFey in the Scimitar lance. Karak is 
being taught now to fish by Stuart OBrien who he has befriended in his 
time with The Guard. 

Fabian Bauhaus: Fabian was chosen for his role specifically by Commander 
Thorbest. A cleric who studied with the Commander, Fabian is an honest man 
whos blunt straight forward answers can rile even the most easygoing 
person. He is however, well liked within The Guard and his skill with the 
broadsword is outstanding. He routinely spars with the other cleric of St. 
Arion in The Black Guard, Tobias Orion, who is a fair match for him.

Sphaler Kendrik: One of the four dwarves found in The Black Guard, Sphaler is 
also the leader of the Lochaber lance. Sphaler comes from the dwarven kingdom 
of Stokh and is a blood relative of the King; Drowbane. Sphaler met The Circle 
members when they first visited Stokh early in the year 123 of the Second 
Age of Magic, and was sent by his King to look after the Kings blood brother, 
Lord Alexander Celestian. When he arrived in Ille Coronos, Alexander told 
Sphaler that he should join the Black Guard and thus look after not only 
him, but all of the council members. This idea appealed to Sphalers sense 
of honour, thus he joined the Guard. Many of the young Guard members look 
to Sphaler as a mentor and he takes this responsibility seriously, 
training new members in weapon drills and tenets of the Black Guard.

Null Hansgottir: Null is the only gnome in the Black Guard. He is a master 
in the use of the gladius and has tried more than once to invent a machine 
which makes the perfect weapon. Null lost his family to the drow when he 
was young, which explains why he is more subdued than is normal for his 
race. There were worries at first that a thirst for revenge was that which 
drove Null to join the Black Guard, but over time it was apparent 
that he has forgotten those thoughts and is happy in his new position.
