::: ELVES :::

	Elves tend to be somewhat shorter and slimmer than normal humans.
Their features are finely chiselled and delicate, and they speak in melodic
tones. Although they appear fragile and weak, as a race they are quick and
strong. Elves often live to be over 1,200 years old, although long before
this time they feel compelled to depart the realms of men and mortals. Where
they go is uncertain, but it is an undeniable urge of their race.
	Elves are often considered frivolous and aloof. In fact, they are
not, although humans often find their personalities impossible to fathom.
They concern themselves with natural beauty, dancing and singing, unless
necessity dictates otherwise. They are not fond of ships or mines, but enjoy
growing and gazing at the open sky. Even though elves tend toward haughtiness
and arrogance at times, they regard their friends and associates as equals.
They do not make friends easily, but a friend (or enemy) is never forgotten.
They prefer to distance themselves from humans, have little love for dwarves,
and hate the evil denizens of the woods. 
	Their humour is clever, as are their songs and poetry. Elves are
brave but never foolhardy. They eat sparingly; they drink mead and wine, but
seldom to excess. While they find well-wrought jewellery a pleasure to behold,
they are not overly interested in money or gain. They find magic and
swordplay (or a refined combat art) fascinating. If they have a weakness it
lines in these interests.
	Over all the elvish races, these notes best describe the high elf, the
most common and abundant of the elvish races.
