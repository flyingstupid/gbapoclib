::: HALFLINGS :::
	
	Halflings are short, generally plump people, very much like small
humans. Their faces are round and broad and often quite florid. Their hair is
typically curly and the tops of their feet are covered with coarse hair. They
prefer not to wear shoes whenever possible. Their typical life expectancy is
approximately 150 years.
	Halflings are sturdy and industrious, generally quiet and peaceful.
Overall they prefer the comforts of home to dangerous adventuring. They enjoy
good living, rough humour, and homespun stories. In fact, they can be a
trifle boring at times. Halflings are not forward, but they are observant
and conversational if in friendly company. Halflings see wealth only as a
means of gaining creature comforts, which they love. They are not overly
brave or ambitious, they are generally honest and hard working when there
is need.
	Halfling homes are well-furnished burrows or cottages, although most
of their down is done on the surface. Elves generally like them in a
patronising sort of way. Dwarves cheerfully tolerate them, thinking halflings
somewhat soft and harmless. Gnomes, although they rink more and eat less,
like halflings best, feeling them kindred spirits. Because halflings are more
open and outgoing than any other demihuman race, they get along with other
races far better.
