/* dark forest */
/* dread swamp */
/* Lost city */
/* some sort of connecting passage way shall lead to a large */
/* forest. as you travell deeper into the forest, it slowly */
/* becomes swampy. The swamp has many dead-end trails. One trail alone */
/* shall lead the adventurous travellor to a great, dead city. */
/* ie...there are no humanoid races that occupy this city now. */
/* However, with the grandness of the remaining buildings, temples */
/* fountains, etc., tells you it could only be <cityname>, the once */
/* powerful sister-city of Minos herself. ...perhaps a book could */
/* be added to a library in minos vaguely hinting of the former */
/* relationship between the two kingdoms....  Now, many dreadful */
/* creatures roam through the streets of the lost city, and */
/* even more unspeakable things haunt it by night.... */

/* this would be easy to break into three parts for release */
/* Obviously, it needs to be flushed out more, as I have no real */
/* idea what monsters will inhabit each area... */
