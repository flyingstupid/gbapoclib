"A long set of wooden stairs leads down the cliff face to the\n"+
"docks below. At the top of the stairs is the forest of Lonell.\n"+
"Tall trees crowd together, their branches reaching ever skyward.\n"+
"A blanket of dead leaves and branches cover the ground everywhere,\n"+

"Sounds of waves crashing on the cliff face below fill the air. A faint breeze of salt air drifts in\n"+
"from the west. A fallen tree lays to the north, it\n"+
"has rotted, leaving little more than the shell of its once\n"+
"mighty girth. The path has widened from the east, and shows signs\n"+
"that wagons once frequented it. The ruts from many wheels grow deeper\n"+
"as they move westward.\n"


/* for1.c */
"A strong breeze full of the tangy sea air stirs the branches of the\n"+
"many tall trees on the southwest corner of Lonell, and the branches creak\n"+
"and crack as they sway and dance. The great sea stretches to\n"+
"the horizon both to the south and west. The wagon trail bends to follow the shore line.\n"
