I won't tell you\ntoo much about it, I'll let it be a suprise. However, since I am back\nand working on the area again. Please feel free to give me any comments\nor ideas regarding the island. First of all, I'll be going through the\ncurrent area and basically checking the code and revamping it, if it\nshould need it, as I've learnt a lot more since it was first coded. As\nfor the boats, and the speed which they get here, etc. I'm not going to\nchange anything to do with the boats. This level is currently a middle level\narea and players can use gate by the time they are ready to explore this area\nproperly. I will however be looking at having a message displayed in the\nmajority, or some of them at least when a ship pulls into the harbour.\nThat was a suggestion by someone, and I think I should be able to do it.\n\n\t\t\tEnjoy,\n\t\t\t\tSarak\n",}),({"DO what?..........................[Arkangel  Mar 11 01:31]","arkangel","Who put a bulletin board here?

So, in this particular instance, the dust is the remains of\nminotaurs.

I recoded some small things,\nbut nothing major at this point in time. You'll see three new exits around\nthe place. Two of them you cannot use, the other you can. The one you can\nleads to a piece of land for sale from the real estate agent in IC. The\nother two exits are future exits to newer parts of the island. Let me know\nif there's any problems.\n\nSarak.\n",}),({"PS................................[Sarak     Jun 29 00:03]","sarak","Also, if anyone had quit or had their IC room as one of the rooms in\nthe old Minos, you will have noticed you got sent elsewhere.

Sorry again.\n\nSarak\n",}),({"HI................................[Lorre     Jul 24 19:48]","lorre","HI\n",}),({"Re: HI............................[Melchor   Aug  8 08:53]","melchor","Hi right back at ya..  :)\n",}),({"See ya guys.......................[Arkangel  Sep  3 22:18]","arkangel","Meet ya on the next one, and don't be late. :)\n",}),({"key...............................[Lendros   Jun 30 20:28]","lendros","i think it is to simple to get a key for the south door, you just kill royal guard and get the key.\n",}),})
