#You better run by Motorhead
#
#I got no reason to lie to you
#What's in the cards, that's what I do
#I was born a-running, and laughing out loud
#With my feet on the ground and my head in the clouds
#
#You better run, oh baby you better run
#I got a blade like lightning, silver bullets in my gun
#
#I'm short and I'm tall, I'm black and I'm white
#Sometimes I be wrong, sometimes I be right
#I'm iron and steel, I'm bad to the bone.
#You come looking for trouble, honey don't you come alone
#
#I seen 'em come, and I seen 'em go,
#I seen things and been people, that nobody knows
#I'm talking in pictures and I'm painting them black,
#I seen satan coming in a big black cadillac.
