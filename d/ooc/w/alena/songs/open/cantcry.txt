#Can't Cry Anymore      by, Sheryl Crow
#
#Took your car
#I drove to Texas
#Sorry, honey
#But I suspected we were through...
#And I can't cry anymore.
#
#Since I left
#Been feelin' better
#Cause that's what you get when you
#Stay together to long
#And I can't cry anymore.
#
#Wouldn't it be good if we could hop a flight to anywhere
#So long to this life
#So much for pretending
#Bad luck's never-ending
#(Now I know that)
#
#Money comes in
#But the fact is
#Not enough
#Pay my taxes
#And I can't cry anymore.
#
#Gotta brother
#He's got real problems
#Heroin
#There's just no stopping him tonight
#And I won't cry anymore
#
#Wouldn't it be good if we could hop a flight to anywhere
#So long to this life
#So much for pretending
#Bad luck's never-ending
#It's never ending...
#
#Could be worse
#Could've missed my calling
#Sometimes it hurts
#But when you read the writing on the wall
#Can't cry anymore.
#
#Wouldn't it be nice if we could hop a flight to anywhere
#So long to this life
#So much for pretending
#Bad luck's never ending
#
#Too much time I been spending
#With my heart in my hands
#Waiting for time to come and mend it
#I can't cry anymore...
#I can't cry anymore...
#Can't cry anymore...
#I can't cry anymore.
#I can't cry anymore.
