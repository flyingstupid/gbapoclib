#Glycerine   by Bush
#
#must be your skin that i'm sinking in
#must be for real cos now i can feel
#and i didn't mind
#it's not my kind
#not my time to wonder why
#everything's gone white
#and everything's grey
#now you're here now you're away
#i don't want this 
#remember that
#i'll never forget where you're at
#don't let the days go by
#glycerine
#
#i'm never alone
#i'm alone all the time
#are you at one
#or do you lie
#we live in a wheel
#where everyone steals
#but when we rise it's like strawbery fields
#
#if i treated you bad
#you bruise my face
#couln't love you more
#you got a beautiful taste
#don't let the days go by
#could have been easier on you
#i couldn't change though i wanted to
#could have been easier by three 
#our old friend fear and you and me
#glycerine (repeat)
#don't let the days go by
#qlycerine
#
#i needed you more
#when we wanted us less
#could not kiss just regress
#it might just be
#clear simple and plain
#that's just fine
#that's just one of my names
#don't let the days go by
#could've easier on you
#glycerine
