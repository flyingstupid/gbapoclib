#"I Love You Always Forever"
#Now In A Minute

#Feels like I'm standing in a timeless dream
#of light mists and pale amber rose
#feels like I'm lost in a deep cloud of heavenly scent
#touching discovering you
#those days of warm rains come rushing back to me
#miles of windless summer night air
#secret moments shared in the heat of the afternoon
#out of the stillness soft spoken words
#say say it again
#
#I love you always forever
#near and far closer together
#everywhere I will be with you
#everything I will do for you
#
#I love you always forever
#near and far closer together
#everywhere I will be with you
#everything I will do for you
#
#you've got the most unbelievable blue eyes I've ever seen
#you've got me almost melting away
#as we lay there under blue sky with pure white stars
#exotic sweetness a magical time
#say say it again
#
#I love you always forever
#near and far closer together
#everywhere I will be with you
#everything I will do for you
#
#I love you always forever
#near and far closer together
#everywhere I will be with you
#everything I will do for you
#
#say you'll love me forever
#never stop never whatever
#near and far and always and everywhere and everything
#
#say you'll love me forever
#never stop never whatever
#near and far and always and everywhere and everything
#
#I love you always forever
#near and far closer together
#everywhere I will be with you
#everything I will do for you
#
#I love you always forever
#near and far closer together
#everywhere I will be with you
#everything I will do for you
