#A sullen figure walks along a dusty road
#his life was holy and he couldn't bear the load
#he left his people and a simple life behind
#he raised his torso and looked into the sky
#shouting his questions
#looking for directions
#"what do i do now?"
#now a confused schoolgirl stares at the T.V. tray
#the stresses of maturing compound every day
#she glances up to see her favorite video
#and gets ideas from madonna's nasty clothes
#in need of affection
#she craves a direction
#her heroes offer her
#everyone is looking for something
#and they assume somebody else knows what it is
#no one can live with the decisions of their own it seems
#so they look to someone else
#to tell'em what to be
#tell'em what to wear
#tell'em what to say
#tell'em how to act and think and compel others
#compulsively
#until the world is all like them
#a righteous came and asked me to reflect
#he judged my lifestyle was politically incorrect
#i don't believe in self important folks who preach
#no bad religion song can make your life complete
#prepare for rejection
#you'll get no direction from me
#you'll get no direction from me
