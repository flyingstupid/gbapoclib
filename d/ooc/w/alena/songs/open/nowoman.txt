#No Woman No Cry
#Hon. Robert Nesta Marley, O.M.
#As done by The Fugees
#
#A dedication to all the refugees worldwide One time say, say, say
#
#I remember when we used to sit in the government yard in Brooklyn.
#Observing the crookedness as it mingled with the good people we meet. 
#Good friends we had, good friends we've lost along the way. 
#In this great future you can't forget your past, 
#So dry your tears I say 
#And to my peoples who passed away, 
#
#No woman, don't cry, 
#no woman don't cry, say say say. 
#Hey little sister don't shed no tears.
#No woman don't cry say say say.
#
#I remember when we used to rock in a project yard in Jersey, 
#And little Georgie would make the firelight, 
#As stolen cars passed through the night
#
#And then we'd hit the corner store
#For Roots, paper, and brew. 
#My drinks, my only remedy 
#For pain of losing family, 
#But while I'm gone shortly,
#
#Everything's gonna be alright, 
#Everything's gonna be alright, 
#Fugees come to the dance tonight, 
#Everything's gonna be alright, 
#
#O everything's gonna be alright, 
#Everything is gonna be alright,
#The gun man's in the house tonight, 
#But everything's gonna be alright. 
#
#Oh ah oh ah (7 times)
#
#No woman don't cry, no woman don't cry. 
#Hey, little sister, don't shed no tears 
#No woman don't cry say say say. 
#I  remember when we used to sit in a government yard in Trenchtown. 
#The hypocrites as they mingled with the good people we meet. 
#
#Good friends we had, oh 
#good friends we've lost 
#Along the way, hey. 
#
#In this great future, 
#You can't forget your past,
#So dry your tears I say 
#And..
#
#No woman don't cry. 
#No woman don't cry say say say.
#Hey, little sister, 
#don't shed no tears
#No woman don't cry 
#
#And to my peoples who passed away...
#
#Oh ah oh ah (5 times)
