#Talula    by Tori Amos
#
#Congratulate you
#said you had a double tongue
#balancing cake and bread
#say goodbye to a glitter girl
#
#Talula
#Talula
#you don't want to lose her
#she must be worth losing
#if it is worth something
#Talula
#Talula
#she's brand new now to you
#wrapped in your papoose
#your little Fig Newton
#
#say goodbye to the old world
#
#ran into the Henchman who severed
#Anne Boleyn
#he did it right quickly a merciful man
#she said 1+1 is 2
#but Henry said that it was 3
#so it was
#here I am
#
#Talula
#Talula
#I don't want to lose it
#it must be worth losing
#if it is worth something
#Talula
#Talula
#she's brand new now to you
#wrapped in your papoose
#your little Fig Newton
#
#and Jamaica
#do you know what I have done
#Mary M weaving on said
#what you want is in the blood Senators
#I got Big Bird on the fishing line
#with a bit of a shout a bit of a shout
#a bit of an angry snout
#he's my favourite hooker of the whole bunch
#and I know about his only Bride
#and how the Russians die on the ice
#I got my rape hat on
#honey but I always could accessorise
#and I never cared too much for the money
#but I know right now
#that it's in God's hands
#but I don't know who the Father is
#
#Talula
#Talula
#I don't want to lose him
#he must be worth losing
#if it is worth something
#Talula
#Talula
#he's brand new now to you
#wrapped in your papoose
#your little Fig Newton
