#Unloved     by Jann Arden
#
#There will be no consolation prize
#This time the bone is broken clean
#No baptism, no reprise and no sweet taste of victory
# all the stars have fallen from the sky
# and everything else in between 
#Satellites have closed their eyes, 
# the moon has gone to sleep
# ...unloved...unloved...unloved...unloved
#
#Here I am inside a hotel choking on a
# million words I said
#Cigarettes have burned a hole and dreams are 
# drunk and penniless
#Here I am inside my father's arms 
# all jagged bone and whisky dry
#Whisper to me sweetly now and tell me I will never die
#...unloved...unloved...unloved...unloved
#
#Here I am an empty hallway
# broken window, rainy night
#I am nineteen sixty-two and I am ready for a fight...
#People crying hallelujah 
# while the bullet leaves the gun
#People falling, falling, falling and I don't know
# where they're falling from
#
#are they...
#...unloved...unloved...unloved...unloved
#
#Hoping that the kindness will lead us
# past the blindness and
# not another living soul will ever have to feel
#...unloved...unloved...unloved...unloved
#
#...unloved...unloved...
