Overview:
=========
   Tic-tac-toe is a 2-player game that is played on a 5x5 grid.  Each player
   takes alternating turns placing either an 'X' or an 'O' in one of the
   grid's spaces.  The game is won by a player when he/she has filled up
   4 spaces in a consecutive manner where it forms a horizontal, vertical,
   or diagonal line.  A draw can also be reached when all the spaces have
   been filled up, yet neither player has won.
