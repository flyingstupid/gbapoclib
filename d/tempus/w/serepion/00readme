   This area is owned by an old woman, who has a minor mouse problem. Her house
has too many mice, and a daring adventurer must kill the mice, and their leader
who has an item of the woman's. It is a nice small area for those newbies.
This isn't a quest, but it kind of is. It gives a nice little reward at the end.
