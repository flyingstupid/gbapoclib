The help system was designed to:
	*  allow any string to be used as a "topic" for help.  Thus it
	   will work with msdos, and illegal file name characters.
	*  Self maintaining.  If a new topic is added or deleted, category
	   lists are automatically updated.
        *  Access to categories are restricted by a call to valid_help()
	   in player.c/wizard.c

aaa.hlp-zzz.hlp contain the help data.  It is accessed using
/function/help.c.

Maintainence of Help

* Help data should be kept to less then 4000 characters.  More extensive
 documents should be made into manuals c.f. /manuals

If you clone the help.c the following maintainence fns are available:


* You add a new help topic by writing the help text to a file <file>,
  then use the command

	convert file topic_name <category>

  - this has two effects (i) it adds the file txt, and topic name to the
			     help data files.

			(ii) it adds the topic name to the category
			     list in /help/subtopic/

  if the topic name already exists it will not add the topic.

* Help data can be deleted with,

	del topic

* Help data can be updated/overwritten with,

	uh file topic

* Help data can be extracted into a file with,

	extract file topic


* There are some other maintaining functions that were used initially
  to convert the original docs to this help system, but they should
  not be needed.

  hdir <dir> <category>   convert whole directory to help data
  ut                      read all data files and rewrite category files
