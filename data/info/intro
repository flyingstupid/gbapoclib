Making a Character

This is a role playing mud where you will take on the persona of a fictional
character that you create. The name should be unlike any other character you
know of, whether in books, or from other role playing material. Likewise,
the name should also be unique.

The main idea of this game is role playing, fighting, socialising OOC
(out of character), and to have fun.

You will now be asked some questions about your character:

  1) The Name you want to use for this fictional character you will play.
  2) A password that is unique to that character
  3) Your email address. If you don't have one, give one where you 
	 can be reached.
  4) The gender of your character; male or female.
  5) The race of your character.
  6) And finally, a description of that character.


WARNING: We are serious about our rules for naming your character. If your
name does not comply with our rules the Administration reserves the right
to remove it without notification.
