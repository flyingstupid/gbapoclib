	::: Prices :::

The prices of items can be found in their respective manual files.
Prices for armour can be found in the armour manual, and so on.

With respect to treasure items, keep the value below around 5000 coins,
as this will equate to roughly 5 gold pieces. Anything above that is
while rather exessive still permitted.
