		Movement

Movement within the MUD is quite simple.  There are obvious exits listed after
the room description in every room.  However, pay close attention to those
descripions because there may be secret exits or such actions possible in
special rooms.  Compass directions have been automatically alias'ed for 
you.  North = n, South = s, East = e, West = w, Northeast = ne, 
Northwest = nw, Southeast = se, Southwest = sw, Up = u, Down = d.
