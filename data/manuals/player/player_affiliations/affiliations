Manuals File: Affiliations

Affiliations are player groups formed under a particular theme. 
Some offer special abilities, others do not. The basis of the 
affiliation is to offer some role playing elements to players, 
and some variable abilities and skills to keep players interested.

The main idea behind an affiliation is not to give players powers, 
but to form clans or player groups who share special interests.

Joining an Affiliation
===============
In order to join an affiliation go to where it meets. If you type:

Command: leaders

you will see a list of players who help to run the affiliation, 
or clan. You need to find one such leader if you are to join the
affiliation. 

You can join any number of affiliations, the only problem is that 
some leaders may require special tasks to be performed in order 
to join.



Priests
=====
Priestly affiliations worship some deity, and in turn gain 
special powers that differ dependent upon the god itself. 
Non cleric players may also join these affiliations. 
Often, these players form part of the military, or special 
forces that ally themselves with the church. While the 
priests gain special powers through their prayers, other 
classes gain no such bonuses.

Some priestly affiliations require certain alignments to be 
maintained in order to gain special bonuses. It is advised 
that you read the manuals on the gods before you 
decide what deity to follow.

Command: man gods
