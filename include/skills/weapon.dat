# This config file contains the "legal" weapon name that a class
# can wield.  If they are multi-classed, and the weapon name is part
# of the field then they can use the weapon. 
#
# '#' hash is for comments
# format:
#
# @skill_name: list of weapons separated by comma ',' :fail_string.
# NOTE: weapon list white space (ie " ") is removed, however "\ " symbol
#       will be replaced by a " " when loading weapon names. Thus
#       war hammer => warhammer, and war\ hammer => war hammer
