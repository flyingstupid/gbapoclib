RACE FILES

The files contained herein are the modular race system files
for players. 

When you make a new race, put all the bonuses into this file 
after inheriting player.c 

When a player logs in the base part of his race, like elf if he
is a grey elf, or the whole race name, like giant if he is just
a giant, his race object gets cloned to him.

Only PCs and not NPCs use these files.

It's just an easy way to add more races.
