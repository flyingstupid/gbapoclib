long_desc "The inner sanctumn of the temple looks more like a pub than \na place of worship. There are scraps of food all near the   \npodium where the priest comes to speak, as if people have   \nheard a bad joke, or a funny one, and tossed fruit and cream\npies in that direction. Behind the podium are several drapes\nof silver, blue, black and red, that shine in the candle light\nfrom the candelabrahs at the sides of the room. Hanging from \nthe ceiling, infront of the drapes, is a shield which bears\na symbol on its surface.\n"
