[ Party System ]
	The party system is a simply configured object which can either
be saved upon a quit, or remove the player from the party. The object
and daemon store all party members, experience, and party age in an
array. The list of best parties is now obtained through a function in
the party daemon.
	Other files include:


party.cfg
	Fn specs for the party objects

party_d.c
	Party 'daemon' object which handles party data storage and retrieval

party_ob.c
	Party object which is cloned to a player
