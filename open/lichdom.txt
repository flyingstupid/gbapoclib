1) Prepare the phylateracy. This is where the lich's soul will be stored, away from its body. Whereas the body can then be destroyed, the soul is not and can regenerate a new body within hours.

2) To do this an item of no less than 2,000gp value must be found,. The item must resist the passage of time (resistant to decay), hence wood, for instance, is unsuitable). A genstone is normally used, particularly pearl, ruby, carbuncle, and jet, often set in the hilt of a sword or other weapon. Enchanting the item with a 'magic jar' is part of the magical routine.

3) A special potion is then prepared. The potion can vary depending on the race or age of the wizard, but it must contain a potion of invulnerability and a potion of etherealness.

4) There is only a 50% chance that the potion is entirely successful. 10% that is will cause death, 30% that it will merely injure the drinker (causing paralysis, loss of functioning of a limb, or other ailments), and 10% that it will have no effect at all.

5) If it works, the spirit of the wizard transfers to the host, regardless of the distance between the wizards body and the host. A dim light within the host indicates the presence of the spirit. While contained in the host, the spirit cannot take any actions; it cannot be contacted nor attacked by magic. The spirit can remain in the host indefinitely.
