COMBAT
======
Part of your travelling experience will involve, no doubt, some
combat with foes of various sorts. In the lands of Magia there
are many villains and foes to meet and conquer. Be warned, however,
that you won't be able to kill them all right now. You need to
familiarise yourself with the inhabitants of many lands, develop
other skills (both magical and otherwise) before you can gauge 
the strengths of even goblins and orcs!

A handy thing I have found while travelling myself is that animals
are the easiest of foes; dogs, cats, farm animals (yes, they can
be very scary indeed!). Don't try to attack guards or people you
meet early on in your adventuring career, be patient.

Also, don't forget to train in your weapon. In Ille Coronos, the 
Captain of the guard, Tesmond, often can help your weapons skills.
Go and find him, and train in your dagger or knife! . . . you might
learn a thing or two about combat which will help you in your hunt
for sport.

 Of course this is not an entirely exact map. Ille Coronos changes all the time
as new people settle in the city.

From what I can recall from my travels there can be found
a weapon or two in the gardens. Due to the animals in there 
the occasional adventurer will often leave items in there,
like a knife or a bag for you to store items.

Also, if you wish to train, seek out the guard's barracks; that's where
all the guards train for battle and war.

SKILLS
====== 
The city of Ille Coronos is a place of learning. There are
A few places you can visit to train your weapon skills, 
learn about theology, or even learn the mathemagical principles
of the wizards. Rumours even have it that the merchants guild
have an underground thief network that support the government
here with various spying activities. ..but that's only a rumour.



GETTING IN TROUBLE
==================
1st level newbies have the magical power, granted to them by the gods,
of avoiding terror, trouble, and places that make them get lost. If you
do get into trouble, then type 'church', and you will be magically 
transported back to the temple of the All-God!



Enjoy your stay in our fair city.
Bastian
