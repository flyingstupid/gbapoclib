			 The PRIESTHOOD of the ALL-GOD
			~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	The All-God is the supreme deity of all Magia, and indeed the entire
multiverse. All deities ultimately report to Him. His word is law among all
gods and goddesses, regardless of alignment.

All-God's Avatar
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	He appears in three known forms. As a simple man of non-descript
appearance He is a story teller, and favourite among children. He helps those
in need, and rewards those faithful to Him.
	Appearing as a great spirit the plainsmen call Heng, He is the 
personal spirit guide of his followers, giving council and renewing his 
clerics powers and faith.
	Finally, the last form is that of the Father. No one knows what He
looks like in this form, save that He radiates a light so pure and so bright,
that no mortal, or immortal can look upon Him.

	In any chosen form the avatar of the All-God can affect any being 
with any chosen power, physical, spiritual, or magical. Likewise, He can only
be affected if He so chooses. Any being, at the Father's will, instantly
becomes of lawful good alignment.

Duties of the Priesthood
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	As the supreme deity of Magia, and certainly the Multiverse, his holy
priests mirror his goodness, justice and power. They often find themselves in
positions of high office as advisers to kings and rulers, or as magistrates
and judges. They are expected to be true and fair in all matters, upholding
goodness where ever they are found.

	Symbol: Their symbol is that of a simple crucifix encircled by two 
gold dragons in a figure eight to signify infinity. No one today can be 
certain of the origin of the crucifix, but all sages agree that it is the
oldest of lawful good icons. 
	The figure eight is an addition dating back to the end of the time 
of dreams where the good dragons joined the legions of the All-Gods holy
knights to force the evil from the lands of man. It is at this time that the
noblest of all dragons, Bahamut the Platinum Dragon, ascended into the heavens
as the god of all his kind.

	Aims, Credo, and Rituals: The priests of the All-God hold the Way,
Truth and the Light as the only way to receive salvation, and passage to 
the Heavens.

	"'Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.' This is the greatest and the most important commandment. The second most important commandment is like it: 'Love your neighbour as you love yourself'".
	- Matthew 22:37-40
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


	To live by example is paramount to the belief of His followers. 
Priests and believers show their faith by the works they do, and can often be
found helping the poor, giving shelter, healing the sick, and offering help 
to all who need it. Thus, priests do not make ritual sacrifices or offerings,
for their lives are the offerings they make to their God.
	Worship is also given by teaching the ways of their God. Sermons in 
the form of parables are often told as a way of relating the ideas and
teachings of the All-God to the common man. Preaching in this way is 
considered of the upmost importance by clerics and believers. Common themes
that run in their sermons is love, peace, and patience. 
	Clerics are expected to live in this way; their lives an example to 
all others.

	"Instead as the scripture says: 'If your enemy is hungry, feed him; if
he is thirsty, give him a drink; for by doing this you will make him burn with
shame.' Do not let evil defeat you; instead, conquer evil with good."
	- Romans 11:20-21.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


	Clerics of the All-God observe but one ritual holiday per year. This 
is Godsday, where it is written that an Avatar of the All-God came down to the
earth to commune with his followers. Such is a time of fellowship and
merriment.
