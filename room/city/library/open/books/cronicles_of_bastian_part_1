Travels of Bastian, the Scholar
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Having ventured to the city of Ille Coronos, on the Great Northern Continent
of Magia, I discovered a veritable oasis of farming land to its northeast.
Here, cattle grazed happily, and the crops seemed to prosper all year round.
I know not why this is the case. I know lands of similar latitudes that can
produce no crop what so ever. The goddess Antaaries must bless this place!

I did discover, however, that the land is constantly watched by spies from
the great mountain ranger to the north. Darken Mountain is believed to be
the home of the Noquar family - noble drow who rule with an iron fist. To
my surprise I encountered a partol of their weaker allies. In my younger
days I would have found this quite a challenge, but combat with them was not
terribly difficult, and I managed to escape their blades with my life in tact.
Had it been a drow patrol I would not have lived to tell the tale!

The lands to the west are much more different. The forest is known as 
Scianthian by the elves who live there. They are an isolated bunch, but
when you get to know them they are rather friendly. I would ask that you
watch our for the fey wine, however. While the elves drink it in abundance

I have it on good authority that even a dwarf could not drink much of it
before he passed out into a blissful sleep that lasts for decades. Many
a tale has come to my own ears of humans who have been taken in by elves
not to return until their hair was long with age!

This forest, however, is not without its dark side. The forest, in its most
northern parts, I have seen to be taken by the drow themselves! Unknown to 
the simple elvish folks a drow priestess and her drow scouts trapse through
these parts.

They must only be in training, for if these were seasoned warriors they
would have slain me! The priestess, on the other hand, has Lolth by her
side. She calls to Lolth often, and is granted powers I have only seen
true believers granted. With this unholy might she strikes down her
victims in the name of Lolth.

I don't much like Lolth.

Beyond her is a cave; guarded of course. I did not venture forth, for I
believed it to be too dangerous for me in that stage of my adventuring 
career.
