::: DWARVES :::

Dwarves are short, stocky fellows, easily identified by their size and shape.
They average 4 to 4 feet tall. They have ruddy cheeks, dark eyes, and dark
hair. Dwarves generally live for 350 years.
	Dwarves tend to be dour and taciturn. They are given to hard work and
care little for most humour. They are strong and brave. They enjoy beer, ale,
mead, and even stronger drink. They're chief love, however, is precious
metal, particularly gold. They prize gems, of course, especially diamonds and
opaque gems (except pearls, which they do not like). Dwarves like the earth
and dislike the sea. Not overly fond of elves, they have a fierce hatred of
orcs and goblins. Their short, stocky builds make them ill-suited for riding
horses or other large mounts (although ponies present no difficulty), so they
tend to be a trifle dubious and wary of these creatures. They are ill-
disposed toward magic and have little talent for it, but revel in fighting,
warcraft, and scientific arts such as engineering.
