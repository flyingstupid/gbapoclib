::: GNOMES :::

	Kin to dwarves, gnomes are noticeably smaller than their distant
cousins. Gnomes, as they proudly maintain, are also less rotund than dwarves.
Their noses, however, are significantly larger. Most gnomes have dark tan or
brown skin and white hair. A typical gnome lives for 350 years.
	Gnomes have lived and sly sense of humour, especially for practical
jokes. They have a great love of living things and finely wrought items
particularly gems and jewellery. Gnomes love all sorts of precious stones
and are masters of gem polishing and cutting.
	Gnomes prefer to live in areas of rolling, rocky hills, well wooded
and uninhabited by humans. Their diminutive stature has made them suspicious
of the larger races - humans and elves - although they are not hostile. They
are sly and furtive with those they do not know or trust, and somewhat
reserved even under the best of circumstances. Dwelling in mines and burrows,
they are sympathetic to dwarves, but find their cousins' aversion to surface
dwellers foolish.
