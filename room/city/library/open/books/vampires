                         [ Vampires ]

     The most dreaded of the evil undead is the night-prowling
vampire (or vampyre). These creatures must rest in a coffin or
similar receptacle during the hours of sunlight unless beneath
the surface of the ground, and in the latter case they must
occasionally return to such rest, for their power is restored by
contact with soil from their grave. 

     Like all undead, vampires have power from the negative
material plane, and can drain living essence from creatures. This
also gives them strength beyond mortal comprehension; some
vampires endowed with the strength of ten men.

     Sleep, charm, and hold spells are not known to affect
vampires. Neither do paralysis or poison, as they do not have a
living metabolism.

     Legend claims that vampires recall from strong garlic, the
face in a mirror, or a cross (or several other holy symbols of
good) if any of these objects are presented boldly. There have
been accounts, however, of vampires who enjoy garlic, and for
whom such symbols do not pose a problem.

     One thing is assured, and that is their aversion to
sunlight, which has been known to destroy them utterly.
