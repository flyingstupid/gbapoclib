When a player dies, only two files are utilised, along with the choice of
many script files.

death_mark.c is cloned to the player when he/she dies.
death_room.c is the place to which the player is moved when he/she dies.

The death_mark.c is auto_loading, with a timer, so that if a player logs
out, when he logs back in he will enter the death scene at the same point
at which he left it.

The death scene is mainly to make the player wait a while, to cool off, before
he allowed to re-enter play again. If the .txt files are changed, please
keep the length of the death scene to less than two minutes.

A heart_beat within the death_mark.c reads script from a file that matches
his alignment. Hence, each time the player dies, his death scene is dependant
upon his alignment. Other script files may be added to the /room/death/open
directory, and the death_mark.c object changed to accomodate these.
