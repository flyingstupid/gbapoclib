#Your head swims as it strikes the ground as you fall, your wounds lethal.
#Your eyes roll and you hear your breath escape your lips one last time...
#A soft voice whispers "...wake up little one..."
#Surprisingly your eyes open, the lids fluttering as they try to fucus.

#A smallish woman stands before you, her right hand outstretched. A long
white cloak surrounds her small frame, and the sleeves hang loose about
her wrists.
#You move, trying to rise, but your body feels so very heavy and pain 
moves down your side and into your legs.
#You wince and look up at the woman.

#She whispers softly "it's alright..."
#She crouches down and lays a soft hand upon your body, her eyes seeming
to glow lightly. A tingling sensation fills your being.

#Your eyes flutter closed for just a moment, then as they reopen you begin 
to move your arms and legs, noticing the numbness beginning to fade.
#As she moves to rest back upon her heels you catch a glimpse of a silver
dagger at her right hip, hidden beneath the folds of her cloak.

#"You're....You're Alena..."

#Her eyes smile softly and she nods her head slowly.
#"My name rings knowingly within your mind, little one?"

#Nodding your head slowly you watch her as she stands before you.
#Her soft smile changes to one expressing her happiness.

#After a brief moment a silver falcon lands upon her shoulder with a
torn piece of cloth in his mouth. A sad sigh parts her lips.

#"I must go now my friend...another needs me."

#The falcon takes wing. Alena turns on heel and on sure, swift feet she
races after. 
#As she passes behind a rock she vanishes.

#Your close your eyes a moment, rubbing your head gently.
#When you reopen your eyes slowly you find yourself somewhere new...
