#Your soul rises far above your slain body, upward toward the heavens.
#An infinite expanse of silvery light fills your eyes...
#You float for days... weeks.... years...
#Pools of coloured light float past... pools of multi-coloured hues.
#An amethyst pool catches your eye not far away... you feel drawn to it.
#Faster and faster you move toward it ...until....

#There is a sudden flash of light...

#When the light from your eyes clear you find yourself standing in a 
barren, dusty place without life or greenery, baking beneath a hellred sun.
The sounds of beating wings turns your attention skyward.

#A huge sickly grey beast with rams horns and a goats head looms overhead.
#Orcus grins evilly.
#Orcus says: HURRY UP, DEATH AWAITS YOU.

#Orcus swoops down, scooping your frail after-life body in his clutches.
His grasp is painfuly cold, and Orcus grins as he enjoys your sorrow.

#Orcus haults at a large iron gate, which swings open before you.
Orcus says: GO IN, MORTAL.

#You walk the cold grey stone corridors, your feet echoing in the silence.
At the end, a lone figure stand, his eyes glowing red, his skeletal hand
clutching at a long staff-sythe. A fear you have never known fills your soul.

#Death says: WELCOME TO THE ABYSS, YOUR SOUL IS NOW MINE.
#Death grins, his skeletal white teeth showing through the darkness of his
hood. Death grabs you arm, his touch burning your flesh, and draws you closer.

#Death's red eyes flicker an evil you have never known.
#Death says: YOU HAVE SERVED MY CAUSE WELL... EVIL AND CHAOS... AND BROUGHT
             SUFFERING INTO THE HEARTS OF MANY. YOU HAVE DELIGHTED IN WHAT I
             STAND FOR...  ...AND I THANK YOU.

#Death grins evilly.
#Death flings open the cold iron door before you, revealing a sickenning sight.
A cold wind blows ice and snow over slaves working a machine. People cry out
to you, their hands reaching out toward you, their eyes filled with pain. This
is the reward for the pain they gave in life... ...their suffering now brings
pleasure to Death.

#Death exclaims: ENJOY IT, MY SERVANT. THIS IS YOUR ETERNAL REWARD!
#Death cackles evilly.

#Suddenly the air is filled with a crackling... warm light fills the room.
#From a golden portal, Angel steps bodly forth.
Death cowers from the light.
#Angel winks at you.
#Angel whispers to you: Into the portal.... hurry!
#Orcus appears in a blinding flash of red light beside Death.
Orcus growls at Angel.

#Orcus charges Angel, not wanting to let your soul free from Death's grasp.
Angel lets a burst of white light at Orcus.

#Death growls.
#Angel lets fly a lightning bolt toward Death, stricking him off balance.
#Death's grip on your arm loosens.

#Angel exclaims: Run!
Death exclaims: NO! YOUR HEART IS EVIL! YOUR SOUL IS MINE TO TORMENT!
#Angel runs toward Death, knocking Orcus from his feet. 
Orcus curses Angel.

#Angel pushes you toward the portal.
Angel whispers to you: This is your new chance to give up your evil.
                       Make good your escape!

#Angel begins to chanting in an ancient language.

#The portal closes as the battle continues.
Death swings his sythe at Angel, and Orcus howls in victory.

#You see Angel smile at you as Death's sythe meets his body.
...your head begins to spin... your eyes become heavy...darkness envelops you.

#You feel your body drifting...drifting in an endless void...

#Your head then begins clear, and the blackness that covers your eyes lifts.

#You suddenly find yourself in a building. It seems vaguely familiar...
