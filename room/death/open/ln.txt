#Your soul rises far above your slain body, upward toward the heavens.
#An infinite expanse of silvery light fills your eyes...
#You float for days... weeks.... years...
#Pools of coloured light float past... pools of multi-coloured hues.
#A golden pool catches your eye not far away... you feel drawn to it.
#Faster and faster you move toward it ...until....

#There is a sudden flash of golden light

#The All-God says: AT LAST YOU ARE HOME, MY CHILD
#Before you stands a tall, elderly man, with a great long white beard.
He smiles as you stand before him, and you feel at peace.

#The All-God says: WALK WITH ME A WHILE, THERE IS MUCH TO DISCUSS.

#The landscape around you is bathed in a soft light of the colour and 
shade of a warm gold and silver. Soft snow peaked mountains stretch 
endlessly toward a golden sky. These are the peaks of the Seven Heavens.

#Seated under a tree is Angel.

#The All-God says: I AM SURE YOU KNOW OF ANGEL
#Angel smiles happily at you.
#The All-God whispers something to Angel.
#Angel nods with respect.

#The All-God says: ANGEL IS HERE TO TAKE YOU BACK TO THE WORLD
#The All-God says: THERE IS GREAT EVIL IN THE WORLD, SO MUCH SO THAT WE
                   NEED GOOD HEROES LIKE YOURSELF TO DEFEAT IT.

#Angel nods knowingly.
#The All-God says: YOUR PLACE HERE, YOUR AFTERLIFE, IS ASSURED, BUT YOUR
                   POWERS AND SKILLS ARE INVALUABLE. WE NEED YOU TO RETURN.

#Angel begins chanting in an unknown language.
#Colours begin to swirl around you...
#Your eyes feel heavy.... your soul feels free once more...
#You feel your body drifting...drifting in an endless void...
#Your head then begins clear, and the blackness that covers 
your eyes lifts.

#You suddenly find yourself in a building. It seems vaguely familiar...
