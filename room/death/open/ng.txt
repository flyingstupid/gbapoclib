#Your soul rises far above your slain body, upward toward the heavens.
#An infinite expanse of silvery light fills your eyes...
#You float for days... weeks.... years...
#Pools of coloured light float past... pools of multi-coloured hues.
#An emerald green pool catches your eye not far away... you feel drawn to it.
#Faster and faster you move toward it ...until....

#There is a sudden flash of green light


#When the light from your eyes clear you find yourself standing in a 
 great oak forest, and sense you are deep within the heart of some 
 sacred grove ...somewhere in the Happy Hunting Grounds... ,      

#Antaaries says: IT IS TIME, MY CHILD,
#Antaaries gathers her leaf green cloak about her and looks sadly at you.
#You feel the sadness of her tears penetrate your soul.
 
#Antaaries says: IT IS ALWAYS SAD WHEN A MORAL SOUL IS LOST IN BATTLE. 
   

#Antaaries says: CHILD, YOUR MORTAL LIFE HAS SHOWN ME YOUR TRUE WAYS OF
                 YOUR SOUL. ALL THIS HAS PATHED THE WAY FOR YOUR 
                 ETERNAL AFTERLIFE. THIS IS THE WAY OF THE GODS.

#Antaaries says: YOU ARE INDEED A NOBLE SOUL, WORTHY OF MY PRAISE AND 
                 A GOOD PLACE IN THE AFTERLIFE HERE WITHIN MY FORESTS.  

#Antaaries says: THERE ARE MANY NOBLE CREATURES HERE IN MY SERVICE, 
                 PERHAPS YOU COULD TAKE ONE OF THEIR PLACES, MY CHILD?

#Antaaries makes a beckoning motion and you step closer. 

#Antaaries, taking your hand, walks casually through of the giant forest  
and heads down a long leafy path through the heart of the forest.

#Antaaries stops at a huge arch openning into a grassy green field.  
Beyond you can see elvish brothers and sisters singing and dancing, 
painting, feasting and making merry.

#Antaaries says: ENJOY, MY CHILD. YOUR NOBLE LIFE HAS EARNED YOU THIS.


#An interdimensional gate opens behind you, and Angel steps through.
#Angel smiles at you.

#Angel whispers something to Antaaries.
#Antaaries says: PERHAPS YOU ARE RIGHT, ANGEL.
#Antaaries looks at you with wise eyes.

#Antaaries says: ANGEL SUGGESTS THAT YOUR NOBLE NATURE IS AN EXCELENT 
                 COMBATANT AGAINST EVIL, AND YOU SHOULD CONTINUE YOUR WORK,
#Angel nods happily at Antaaries.

#Antaaries says: THIS IS TRUE. THERE IS MUCH EVIL TO BE DESTROYED ON THE 
                 WORLD. I SHALL SEND YOU BACK TO PERFORM THIS DUTY.

#Angel smiles happily at you.
#Angel waves farewell.
#Angel leaves through the magical portal, which closes behind him.

#Antaaries smiles happily.
#Antaaries says: SO SHALL IT BE, I SHALL SEND YOU BACK TO THE WORLD.
                 BUT KNOW THIS, MY CHILD, PERHAPS JUDGEMENT MAY NOT
                 SERVE YOU SO WELL NEXT TIME.

#Antaaries looks at you, and begins to chanting in an ancient language.
#Your head begins to spin... your eyes become heavy...

#You feel your body drifting...drifting in an endless void...

#Your head then begins clear, and the blackness that covers 
your eyes lifts.

#You suddenly find yourself in a building. It seems vaguely familiar...
