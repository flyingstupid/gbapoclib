#Your soul rises far above your slain body, upward toward the heavens.
#An infinite expanse of silvery light fills your eyes...
#You float for days... weeks.... years...
#Pools of coloured light float past... pools of multi-coloured hues.
#A reflective black pool catches your eye not far away... you feel drawn to it.
#Faster and faster you move toward it ...until....

#There is a sudden flash of black light...

#When the light from your eyes clear you find yourself standing in a   
place of bewilderment, of twisted and misshapen trees, giant mushrooms 
of many colours, and kender running around the place.

#Taalandrix appears before you in a puff of pink smoke.
#Taalandrix exclaims: WOW! THAT WAS FUN WASN'T IT !!,
#Taalandrix sweeps back his multi-coloured robes and cackles merrily. 
Taalandrix says: THAT WAS A REALLY FUNNY JOKE, DYING AND ALL.

#Taalandrix makes a beckoning motion and you step closer. 
Standing next to him you vanish, appearing somewhere else...

#Taalandrix giggles.
#Taalandrix says: WELCOME TO LIMBO, MY HOME!
#Taalandrix winks at you.

#Taalandrix exclaims: WELL, THIS IS YOUR AFTERLIFE!

#Taalandrix says: YOU HAVE SUCH A SOUL WITH CHARACTER! I SEE YOU'VE HAD 
                  FUN AND GAMES THROUGHOUT YOUR LITTLE MORTAL LIFE! WHAT  
                  GREAT FUN WE'LL HAVE IN THE AFTERLIFE, MY FRIEND.    

#Taalandrix jumps up onto a mushroom.

#Taalandrix asks: SO WHAT NEW JOKES DO YOU HAVE FOR ME?
                  ANY INTERESTING STORIES? WE HAVE YOUR WHOLE AFTERLIFE!

#Taalandrix ponders the situation.
#Taalandrix says: DO YOU LIKE MUSHROOMS? YOU COULD SPEND YOU WHOLE 
                  AFTERLIFE BEING ONE, IF YOU WANT. OR HOW ABOUT A WHOOPEE
                  CUSHION? NOW THEY'RE FUNNY !!

#Suddenly, the whole mushroom forest explodes in a dazzling white light!

#An interdimensional gate opens behind you, and Angel steps through.

#Angel smiles at you.
#Angel whispers something to Taalandrix.
#Taalandrix winks at Angel.
#Angel whispers something to Taalandrix.

#Taalandrix pouts.
#Taalandrix says: YOU ALWAYS SPOIL MY FUN, Angel.

#Angel frowns at Taalandrix.
#Taalandrix looks at you sadly.
#Taalandrix says: OH, ALRIGHT THEN. I'LL DO IT.
#Angel smiles happily.
#Angel waves farewell.
#Angel leaves through the magical portal, which closes behind him.

#Taalandrix smiles happily.
#Taalandrix bounces around the room.
#Taalandrix says: LOOKS LIKE I HAVE TO SEND YOU BACK.
#Taalandrix says: WELL, I OWED HIM A FAVOUR, AND NOW HE'S COLLECTING ON IT,

#Taalandrix says: SO SHALL IT BE, I SHALL SEND YOU BACK TO THE WORLD.

#Taalandrix says: BUT LETS HAVE SOME FUN FIRST! I THINK I'LL HAVE YOU 
                 REINCARNATED INSTEAD OF RAISED!

#Taalandrix breaks a piece of mushroom from nearby.

#Taalandrix says: EAT THIS.
#Taalandrix gives you a piece of mushroom.
#You eat the mushroom. It smells a little funny.
#Suddenly your head begins to spin... your eyes become heavy...
#You feel your body floating...through time and space...
#Your head becomes clear, and the blackness that covers your eyes lifts.
#You suddenly find yourself in a building. It seems vaguely familiar...
