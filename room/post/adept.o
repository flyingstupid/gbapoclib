Until I'm positive of which port to use, I'd rather not keep it going consistantly.\n\nI'm going to mention it in the inner board, but from now on, any changes done to code in /inherit/*   /include/*   /obj/*   /objects/*   /secure/*   /bin/*  will not be reflected on Avatar unless it's specifically requested.  Even then, it may cause problems, as I will probably be changing the files over there, and it would probably take a decent amount of time to update the file and make it work again.\n\nOnce we get basic commands working, I could use some help with the basic commands.  After that point, I'll start working on the base objects and getting their functionality setup better.\n\nOkay, that didn't make sense.  Once the file editting commands are fixed, I could use some help with the other commands.\n\nEvidently I should be asleep already.\n\nUntil our paths cross again\nVaejor of the Realms\n",0,0,"Feb 20 01:17",}),})
